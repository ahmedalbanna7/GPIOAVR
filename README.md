# GPIOAVR
GPIO, or General-Purpose Input/Output, is a term used in embedded systems and microcontrollers to refer to pins or connectors on a device that can be configured to serve as either digital inputs or digital outputs. GPIO pins provide a way for a microcontroller or computer to interact with the outside world by reading digital signals (input) or sending digital signals (output).

Here are the primary functions of GPIO:

Digital Input: GPIO pins can be configured to read digital signals, which are either high (1) or low (0). They can be used to sense external events, such as the state of a button (pressed or not pressed) or the level of a sensor (e.g., light sensor, temperature sensor).

Digital Output: GPIO pins can be configured to send digital signals. They can be used to control external devices, such as turning on/off LEDs, driving relays, or setting the state of other digital components.

Bidirectional: Some GPIO pins can be configured to operate as both input and output. This is useful when you need to interface with devices that require bidirectional communication, like I2C or SPI devices.

Control and Communication: GPIO pins play a crucial role in the control and communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices or sensors. They can be used to configure and manage communication protocols, trigger interrupts, or simply transfer data.

The exact number of GPIO pins and their capabilities vary from one microcontroller or platform to another. Some devices have only a few GPIO pins, while others offer dozens or even hundreds of them. The configuration and use of GPIO pins are typically done through software, where you can set the direction (input or output), read input values, and write output values.

In summary, GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins are versatile and fundamental components in embedded systems, allowing microcontrollers and computers to interact with the external world by reading digital signals from sensors and controlling external devices through digital output.
